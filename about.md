Hey, I’m Iosi, currently living in Surabaya, Indonesia, and working at Tappz. Thanks for stopping by. 

Here’s what I’m into:

**Product Design:** I'm passionate about making beautifully simple apps.  

**Entrepreneurship:** I’ve tried building startups before - and failed. Now I’m focused on bootstrapping my studio to help me bring my next idea to life.

**Side Projects:** I’m always exploring new things and trying out different projects. 

**Sports:** Lately, I’ve been hitting the gym for some strength training. I also enjoy badminton, swimming, and football, and I’m looking forward to getting into calisthenics soon.
