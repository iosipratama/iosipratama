Hey, I’m Iosi, currently living in Surabaya, Indonesia, and working at [Tappz](https://www.tappz.com/). Thanks for stopping by. 

Here’s what I’m into:

**Software Design:** I love making beautifully simple apps and this is what I do for living. 

**Entrepreneurship:** I’ve tried building startups before - and failed. Now I’m focused on bootstrapping my studio to help me bring my next idea to life.

**Side Projects:** I’m always exploring new things and trying out different projects. 

**Sports:** Lately, I’ve been hitting the gym for some strength training. I also enjoy badminton, swimming, and football, and I’m looking forward to getting into calisthenics soon.
